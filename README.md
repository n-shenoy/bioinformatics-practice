# bioinformatics-practice
A repository for my attempts at solving beginner bioinformatics problems. Created this to track my learning progress. 
Problems are sourced from https://rosalind.info

Here's a list of problems addressed in this repository:
1. Counting DNA nucleotides in a sequence
2. Transcribing DNA into RNA
3. Finding the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length
4. Finding the sequence with the highest GC content
5. Mendel's First Law in action: finding the probability of getting an offspring with a dominant phenotype from two randomly selected organisms from a population
6. Finding the reverse complement of a DNA strand
